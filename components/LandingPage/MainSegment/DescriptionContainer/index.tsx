        When disaster strikes, it is easy to see those affected as victims:
        desolate, destitute, and defeated. Here at Mercy Relief, we see things
        differently. We see people coming together to help one another, fight
        back, and protect their way of life. We witness their indomitable
        spirit, and are committed to supporting it.
