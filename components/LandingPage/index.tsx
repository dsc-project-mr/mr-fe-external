            When disaster strikes, it is easy to see those affected as victims:
            desolate, destitute, and defeated. Here at Mercy Relief, we see
            things differently. We see people coming together to help one
            another, fight back, and protect their way of life. We witness their
            indomitable spirit, and are committed to supporting it.
